   <p>
    Having worked in various capacities in different diverse fields and observed the trajection of industrial <br>
    recruitment, with the world moving towards internet technology as the new way of doing things, it became <br>imperative that we
    did not get left behind in the technological revolution. This informed my foray into the IT world.<br> It has been 
    an exciting journey so far. I believe that IT will not  only enhance my engineering business but it will also <br>
    provide an opportunity for a career change in the not too distant future. All this progress I owe to Capacity Bay <br>
    for giving me the opportunity to try my hands at something new.
